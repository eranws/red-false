# red-false

<!--what is it?-->
this is a step-by-step tutorial that walks through building a small but powerful compiler, in 50 lines of code (or less).

<!---why compiler?-->
compiler can seem at first as something very complicated, but thinking of compiling as a translation from one language to another makes it much simpler. 

as translation can be somewhat mechanic, like converting document to pdf,
compiling usually involves translating from high level language into lower one.

front-end and back-end (or, human and machine)

<!--abstraction of memory as stack-->


<!---50 lines of code? how is it so small?-->
writing a 'real' is a bit compilcated and requires specific knowledge in 
machine-level code, like `jsr	-198(a6)`,`exg	a2,a6` and `move.l	d0,-(a5)`

using a high level language **Red** and its parse engine, makes this task easier
(which is a topic for itself)

<!--who is it for?-->
while having previous experience with some programming language is good, if you can add and multiply two numbers then I consider you already as a programmer at level two.

<!--what would I benefit?-->
we will build a compiler for an esoteric (turing complete) language, named **`FALSE`**

gradually built language, 

if you are familiar with the concept of calculator, you can understand how to extend it with *words* - variables and functions.

even if you are seasoned programmer, most of development is using some language, at the variables and function.
 as a user manipulaing symbols and 
you will how to define *how* **lambda functions** can be used to define **control-flow**


programmers
(can learn) with powerful constructs, as while or labmda
