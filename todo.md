* wire i-o: read args into in-buffer, print out-buffer to console
* cool idea: make i and o symbols to access io buffers within false ?!

IO can be an appendix (just read the stack)

make EMET, v2.0
everything is true except epsilon, special value
string should be pushed to top of stack

draw the stack on each step (print-stack)

smash the stack:
pass a false function [[1 2 +]] save to "s:"

* add operators, functions, or closures?


transliterate factorial for example.

`[$1=$[\%1\]?~[$1\-f;!*]?]f:`

f is a function:
    duplicate the top stack value
    if number is 1
    duplicate the top stack value
    return 1 if it is 1
    if not 1
    ca
