# red-false

<!--what is it?-->
this is a step-by-step tutorial that walks through building a small but powerful compiler, in 50 lines of code (or less).

<!---why compiler?-->
compiler can seem at first as something very complicated, but thinking of compiling as a translation from one language to another makes it much simpler. 

front-end (human) back-end (machine)

<!---50 lines of code? how is it so small?-->
writing a 'real' machine-level code is a bit compilcated and requires 

using a high level language makes this task easier 
(Red parse engine is a topic for itself)


<!--who is it for?-->
while having previous experience with some programming language is good, if you can add and multiply two numbers then I consider you already as a programmer at level two.

<!--what would I benefit?-->
we will build a compiler for an esoteric (turing complete) language, named **`FALSE`**

gradually built language, 

if you are familiar with the concept of calculator, you can understand how to extend it with *words* - variables and functions.

even if you are seasoned programmer, most of development is using some language, at the variables and function.
 as a user manipulaing symbols and 
you will how to define *how* **lambda functions** can be used to define **control-flow**


programmers
(can learn) with powerful constructs, as while or labmda
